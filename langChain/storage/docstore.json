You\u2019ll learn all about this inside the course!So whether you\u2019re trying to solve a classic HR analytics problem like predicting who gets promoted, or you\u2019re aiming to predict loan default - the Naive Bayes algorithm will get you on your way.Who is the Naive Bayes from Scratch Course for?This course is for anyone who:The Naive Bayes algorithm is a classic that\u2019s much loved by data scientists all around the world. It's easy to learn and will serve you well in your data science journey.What do you need to get started with the Naive Bayes course?What is Naive Bayes?In machine learning, the Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on the concept of Bayes Theorem. Bayes theorem is one of the fundamental theorems in probability. We will be learning all these concepts in the course quite thoroughlyHow are Naive Bayes and probability related?The Bayes Theorem forms the backbone of the Naive Bayes algorithm. We use conditional probability to classify the data - thus, the Naive Bayes algorithm basically gives us the probability of a record being in a particular class, given the values of the features. This is nothing but conditional probability!What are the assumptions we need to keep in mind for using the Naive Bayes algorithm?The most important assumption that Naive Bayes makes is that all the features are independent of each other. You might also need to convert the continuous variables into discrete variables.What are the different types of Naive Bayes algorithms?There are 3 main types of Naive Bayes algorithms:We will be covering all these techniques comprehensively and with Python code in this course.Can Naive Bayes be used only for binary classification?Not at all - in fact, the Naive Bayes classifier is one of the most popular algorithms for multiclass classification. Depending on the data we are dealing with, we can use any of the 3 types of the Naive Bayes algorithmsHow does Naive Bayes hold up against other classification algorithms?Though classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, random forest, etc are quite popular, Naive Bayes holds its own among them. It is faster than Random forest, since it can adapt to changing data pretty quickly. If the assumptions of Naive Bayes hold true, then it is much faster than logistic regression as well.What are the main advantages of Naive Bayes?The main advantages are:What are the main advantages of Naive Bayes?Like all other algorithms, Naive Bayes has its own set of cons as well:What are the applications of the Naive Bayes algorithm?Though the algorithm is relatively simple to understand, you cannot underestimate the power of the Naive Bayes classifier! It is fast, intuitive, and is used for text classification tasks. Since it can be used for multiclass classification as well, it is considered a very versatile and flexible classifier. A majority of research papers on text classification start off by using the Naive Bayes classifier as the baseline model.\nCurriculum: Probability: Key Terms and Definitions, Introduction to Probability, Quiz: Introduction to probability, Calculating Probabilities of events, Quiz: Calculating Probabilities of events, AI&ML Blackbelt Plus Program (Sponsored);The Naive Bayes Algorithm: Introduction to Naive Bayes, Quiz: Introduction to Naive Bayes, Conditional Probability and Bayes Theorem, Working of Naive Bayes, Quiz: Conditional Probability and Naive Bayes, Math Behind Naive Bayes, Types of Naive Bayes, Quiz: Types of Naive Bayes, Implementing Naive Bayes, Pros and Cons of Naive Bayes, Applications of Naive Bayes, Improve your Naive Bayes Model;What Next?: More Resources and Next Steps", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4147, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f22ae54-ec3d-4e88-92e2-65bd3be7304a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f22ae54-ec3d-4e88-92e2-65bd3be7304a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef3d0831-78c5-4691-abc2-603fe1ca59bb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "30c95fc19fe797216341e50dbebae26888b62f4cbda03572f94a2014daa5e5e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Title: AI Ethics by Fractal\nDescription: AI has a huge influence on our lives.

To cement your understanding of this diverse topic, we will explain the advanced Ensemble Learning techniques in Python using a hands-on case study on a real-life problem!Just like you come to a decision to buy a car by reading multiple reviews and opinions, in machine learning also, you can combine the decisions from multiple models to improve the overall performance. This technique of combining multiple machine learning models is called ensemble learning.Why do we need to know about Ensemble Learning?Ensemble learning is one of the most effective ways to build an efficient machine learning model. You can build an ensemble machine learning model using simple models and yet get great scores which are at par with the resource-hungry models like neural networks.What are the different types of Ensemble Learning techniques?There are simple and advanced ensemble learning techniques.In bagging and Boosting, there are other popular models like Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.We will be covering all these techniques comprehensively and with Python code in this course.Do we use Ensemble Learning techniques only for classification or regression or both?We can use ensemble learning for both types of machine learning problems: Classification and Regression. While techniques like Max Voting are used for classification, techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc can be used for both Classification and Regression problems.What are the more popular ensemble learning techniques?Ensemble learning techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and variants, XGBoost, and LightGBM are extremely popular in hackathons. Depending on the data we are dealing with, we can use these techniques as our machine learning models. For example, you can use LightGBM(Light Gradient Boosting) for large datasets, or CatBoost for when your data has categorical variables.What is the intuition behind Bagging?The idea behind bagging is combining the results of multiple models (for instance, all decision trees) to get a generalized result. Bagging (or Bootstrap Aggregating) technique uses subsets (bags) to get a fair idea of the distribution (complete set).What is the intuition behind Boosting?Boosting is a sequential process, where each subsequent model attempts to correct the errors of the previous model on subsets of the data. The succeeding models are dependent on the previous model. The boosting algorithm combines a number of weak learners to form a strong learner and boost your overall results.What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting?While both bagging and boosting involve creating subsets, bagging makes these subsets randomly, while boosting prioritizes misclassified subsets. Additionally, at the final step in bagging, the weighted average is used, while boosting uses majority weighted voting.Does ensemble learning improve my machine learning model?In a word, yes! And that too drastically! Ensemble learn can improve the results of your machine learning even exponentially at times. There are two major benefits of Ensemble models:As you will learn in the course, we will take a real-life dataset and study how ensemble learning improves the score of our machine learning model as compared to using only simple models.Would knowing about ensemble learning help me crack interviews and hackathons?Ensemble learning is the go-to method to achieve a high rank on hackathon leaderboards.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5481, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d64ec9f-d538-4743-8d99-ff58f531a6e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d64ec9f-d538-4743-8d99-ff58f531a6e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3b97f099-a7d4-4f6f-a496-8266dfefed8c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "af82511c19efec66bc0741106b7a70185b15b7073ee2a93ca6378f8803e71f4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b03bf33-e683-47e7-85a3-b64a47154d97", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "28d7200b52fcfa55b34fcb9abf9dd1cb87538db950146e211af67f3433734c45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The boosting algorithm combines a number of weak learners to form a strong learner and boost your overall results.What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting?While both bagging and boosting involve creating subsets, bagging makes these subsets randomly, while boosting prioritizes misclassified subsets.

There is an unprecedented volume of data on the internet right now - and data science projects often need this data to build predictive models.That\u2019s a key reason why data scientists are expected to be familiar with web scraping.We have found web scraping to be a very helpful technique for gathering data from multiple websites. Some websites these days also provide APIs for many different types of data you might want to use, such as Tweets or LinkedIn posts.But there might be occasions when you need to collect data from a website that does not provide a specific API. This is where having the ability to perform web scraping comes in handy. As a data scientist, you can code a simple Python script and extract the data you\u2019re looking for.So knowing how to perform web scraping using Python will help you go a long way towards becoming a resourceful data scientist. Are you ready to take the next step and dive in?A note of caution here \u2013 web scraping is subject to a lot of guidelines and rules. Not every website allows the user to scrape content so there are certain legal restrictions at play. Always ensure you read the website\u2019s terms and conditions on web scraping before you attempt to do it.In this course, we will dive into the basics of web scraping using Python. We will understand what web scraping is, the different Python libraries for performing web scraping, and finally we\u2019ll implement web scraping using Python in a real-world project. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here so enroll today and start learning!We\u2019re sure you\u2019ve asked these questions before. Even if you haven\u2019t, you should start learning how these web scraping questions should be answered:You\u2019ll learn about these concepts inside the course and we have even provided a high-level overview of these questions after the course curriculum below.Who is the Introduction to Web Scraping using Python Course for?This course is for anyone who:What do you need to get started with the Introduction to Web Scraping using Python course?Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:That\u2019s it! You\u2019re all set to perform web scraping on your machine!What is web scraping?Web scraping is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites. This technique mostly focuses on the transformation of unstructured data (HTML format) on the web into structured data (database or spreadsheet).You can perform web scraping in various ways, including use of Google Docs to almost every programming language.Why should you learn web scraping?Web scraping is incredibly useful when you don\u2019t have enough data with you to train a machine learning model. Web scraping helps us to collect this data from websites (if permitted) and we can then use that to train our model. You can imagine why web scraping is such a prized tool in a data scientist\u2019s arsenal!Why Python for web scraping?Python is the most popular tool out there in the world for Web Scraping. Its 2 prominent libraries - BeautifulSoup and Scrapy makes web scraping easy and efficient. Python\u2019s syntax makes understanding of the codes easy. Also python provides many other libraries for web scraping which can be used as per our needs. Eg- lxml, requests etcWhat are the different Python libraries for performing web scraping?There are many libraries in Python that help us to scrape the web. The 3 most prominent libraries include:Can I use R for web scraping?You sure can! You can perform web scraping in both Python and R. We are teaching you how to do this using Python in the course but feel free to use R if that\u2019s your language of choice. You can go throughthis tutorialthat walks you through how to master web scraping using an R package called rvest.Are web scraping concepts asked in data science/machine learning interviews?This depends a lot on the data science role and the organization you\u2019re interviewing for.

It has left TensorFlow behind and continues to be the deep learning framework of choice for many experts and practitioners.PyTorch is super flexible and is quite easy to grasp, even for deep learning beginners. If you work on deep learning and computer vision projects, you\u2019ll love working with PyTorch.What is PyTorch?PyTorch is a Python-based library that provides maximum flexibility and speed. We\u2019ve found PyTorch to be as simple as working with NumPy! You\u2019ll figure this out inside the course for yourself.We highly recommend learning PyTorch right now - it is quickly becoming the framework of choice for deep learning practitioners. PyTorch will be adopted by the industry soon as well so get on board today!We highly recommend learning PyTorch right now - it is quickly becoming the framework of choice for deep learning practitioners. PyTorch will be adopted by the industry soon as well so get on board today!Why should you learn PyTorch?PyTorch is one of the most popular and upcoming deep learning frameworks that allows you to build complex neural networks. It is rapidly growing among the research community and companies like Facebook and Uber are using it as well.Here is what Andrej Karpathy, head of AI at Tesla, has to say about PyTorch - \u201cI've been using PyTorch a few months now and I've never felt better. I have more energy. My skin is clearer. My eyesight has improved.\u201dPyTorch vs. TensorFlow vs. Keras - which deep learning framework is the best?This is a common question and a relevant one. There is no shortage of deep learning frameworks out there so which one should you choose?There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach here. Each deep learning framework has its own unique set of features which is why data scientists go for one over the other.We recommend checking outthis articleon Analytics Vidhya to understand how PyTorch compares against the other deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras. This will help you settle the PyTorch vs. TensorFlow debate for sure!this articleWhat are the advantages of using PyTorch?The main advantage of PyTorch is the imperative programming feature - which performs computations on your code as you are typing it, so debugging it is super easy! It is also much faster than NumPy and easy to learn too.What are some challenges you might face when using PyTorch?PyTorch is not meant to be an end-to-end deep learning framework and using it for production in the industry remains a challenge. It is also relatively newer than other deep learning frameworks and has only recently released its stable versions.What kind of deep learning projects can you solve using PyTorch?You can work on all sorts of deep learning projects using PyTorch! Here are a few examples:You can check out the different datasets and projects to apply PyTorch on Analytics Vidhya\u2019sDataHack platform.DataHack platformIs PyTorch relevant in the industry?Absolutely! While it\u2019s still in its nascent stage, PyTorch is quickly becoming the go-to tool of choice for a lot of leading organizations. It\u2019s flexible approach and easy-to-understand style have won over a lot of newcomers and industry veterans.Do you need to know deep learning to learn PyTorch?No!

You\u2019ll be able to build charts like bar charts, line charts (for working with time series data), pie charts, and even get the hang of geospatial analysis using map visualizations in Tableau!Note: If you\u2019re looking to build and master dashboards and storyboards in Tableau, make sure you check out the popular \u2018Mastering Tableau from Scratch: Become a Data Visualization Rockstar\u2019 course!Why should you use Tableau?Tableau, as we mentioned above, is the gold standard in analytics and business intelligence. It is a widely used tool in the industry, both in big firms as well as startups. Tableau helps us create effective, impactful and beautiful dashboards and stories that our clients and stakeholders love.There are a ton of job vacancies for Tableau professionals in the industry so this is a great time to get started.Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public - which one should I choose?Tableau Desktop and Tableau Public are two of the many offerings by Tableau. Tableau Desktop is the premium version of Tableau Public. It is used by organizations worldwide for their analytics and business intelligence projects. You will be working with Tableau Desktop in the industry.Tableau Public, on the other hand, is a free platform to learn Tableau. It was created with the purpose of making the broader audience comfortable with Tableau and how it works. Tableau Public offers almost all the features of Tableau Desktop (except you can\u2019t save your work on your local machine - it will be uploaded to Tableau\u2019s public gallery).You can perform all the work provided in this course in Tableau Public.What are the different tools under the Tableau umbrella?Tableau offers a variety of tools catering to different organizations and solutions:And many other tools you can check out on Tableau\u2019s official website.Where can you learn about the intermediate-level of Tableau?Excellent question!

You will learn how to quickly convert your data into actionable insights, create dashboards to impress your clients, and learn Tableau tips, tricks and best practices in your day-to-day role.Can I use Tableau for time series forecasting?Yes, you can. Tableau has an in-built feature for forecasting where you can use the concept of moving average to build forecasts. But keep in mind that this is a crude feature and might not be reliable for your business. Time series is a complex topic and has advanced beyond moving average.However, Tabelau\u2019s forecast feature does give you a rough idea of what to expect and might work for small businesses or if you\u2019re looking for a quick idea of what to expect from your sales numbers, for example.Do you need to know programming to learn Tableau?Not at all. Tableau thrives as a drag-and-drop tool (for the most part). That\u2019s the beauty of Tableau to be honest, you can quickly get started and build awesome visualizations without having to get into any coding or programming.But knowing simple Excel formulas, such as IF-ELSE, will help you with feature engineering in Tableau. And that is a critical part of a business intelligence analysts skillset.What kind of projects can you perform using Tableau?You can take up all sorts of analytics projects next.

Without these evaluation metrics, we would be lost in a sea of machine learning model scores - unable to understand which model is performing well.Wondering where evaluation metrics fit in? Here\u2019s how the typical machine learning model building process works:Evaluation metrics, essentially, explain the performance of a machine learning model. An important aspect of evaluation metrics is their capability to discriminate among model results.If you\u2019ve ever wondered how concepts like AUC-ROC, F1 Score, Gini Index, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Confusion Matrix work, well - you\u2019ve come to the right course!We have seen plenty of analysts and aspiring data scientists not even bothering to check how robust their machine learning model is. Once they are finished building a model, they hurriedly map predicted values on unseen data.This is an incorrect approach.Simply building a machine learning model is not the motive! It\u2019s about creating and selecting a model which gives high accuracy on an out of sample data (or unseen data). Hence, it is crucial to check the accuracy of your model prior to computing predicted values.This is where evaluation metrics help us.What is an evaluation metric?The answer lies in the name itself! Evaluation metrics help us evaluate, or gauge, the performance (or accuracy) of our machine learning model. They are an integral part of the machine learning model building pipeline as we can iterate and improve our model\u2019s performance by judging how it\u2019s working.What are the different types of evaluation metrics?There are several types of evaluation metrics for machine learning models. The choice of the evaluation metric completely depends on the type of model and the implementation plan of the model.The evaluation metrics varies according to the problem types - whether you\u2019re building a regression model (continuous target variable) or a classification model (discrete target variable).In this course, we\u2019re covering evaluation metrics for both machine learning models. Here\u2019s a taste of the different evaluation metrics you\u2019ll find in the course:Do I really need to master evaluation metrics to understand machine learning?The short answer - yes. Evaluation metrics are critical to judging and improving our machine learning model\u2019s performance. And who doesn\u2019t want to do that?Evaluation metrics are a must-know concept for every machine learning and data science aspirant.What kind of evaluation metrics questions can I expect in an interview?Here are a few common questions we\u2019ve seen asked of beginners about evaluation metrics:You\u2019ll get a better idea about how to answer these questions inside the course.How do evaluation metrics help me improve my hackathon rankings?Evaluation metrics, as you might have guessed by now, will be of supreme importance in machine learning hackathons. Your ranking on the hackathon leaderboard will be based on the evaluation metric being used in that hackathon.There\u2019s no getting away from it - evaluation metrics are the lifeblood of your machine learning model\u2019s performance.Can I use the same evaluation metrics for regression as well as classification problems?Not quite. Regression and classification models have their separate evaluation metrics. Remember , the evaluation metric depends on the target variable. If your target variable is continuous (aka a regression problem), you can\u2019t use a classification metric to evaluate it!Is cross validation an evaluation metric?Cross validation is not technically an evaluation metric but we\u2019ve still included this in the course. Cross Validation is one of the most important concepts in any type of machine learning model and a data scientist should be well versed in how it works.\nCurriculum: Introduction: Types of Machine Learning, Why do we need Evaluation Metrics?, AI&ML Blackbelt Plus Program (Sponsored);Evaluation Metrics: Classification: Confusion Matrix, Quiz: Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Quiz: Accuracy, Alternatives of Accuracy, Quiz: Alternatives of Accuracy, Precision and Recall, Quiz: Precision and Recall, F-Score, Thresholding, AUC-ROC, Quiz: AUC-ROC, Log Loss, Quiz: Log Loss, Gini Coefficient;Evaluation Metrics: Regression: MAE and MSE, RMSE and RMSLE, Quiz: RMSE and RMSLE, R2 and Adjusted R2, R2 and Adjusted R2;What Next?: Cross-Validation, The Way Forward", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4466, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5928b03b-ceca-4e57-9860-8b3b341c7de0": {"__data__": {"id_": "5928b03b-ceca-4e57-9860-8b3b341c7de0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b47d79e9-29b6-46e6-8239-cd19220c687e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d5ea39cb402aaf8577dd4b2fa3de41524d5c3c69b917bda841b06ac8d0212fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Title: Dimensionality Reduction for Machine Learning\nDescription: Have you worked on a dataset with more than a thousand features? How about 40,000 features? We are generating data at an unprecedented pace right now and working with massive datasets in machine learning projects is becoming mainstream.This is where the power of dimensionality reduction techniques comes to the fore. Dimensionality reduction is actually one of the most crucial aspects in machine learning projects.You can use dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the number of features in your dataset without having to lose much information and keep (or improve) the model\u2019s performance. It\u2019s a really powerful way to deal with huge datasets, as you\u2019ll see in this course!Every data scientist, aspiring established, should be aware of the different dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis, t-SNE, High Correlation Filter, Missing Value Ratio, among others.So in this beginner-friendly course, you will learn the basics of dimensionality reduction and why you should know dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We will also cover 12 dimensionality reduction techniques! This course is as comprehensive an introduction as you can get!Who is the Dimensionality Reduction for Machine Learning Course for?This dimensionality reduction course is designed for machine learning folks who:What is dimensionality reduction?Dimension Reduction refers to the process of converting a set of data having vast dimensions into data with lesser dimensions ensuring that it conveys similar information concisely. These dimensionality reduction techniques are typically used while solving machine learning problems to obtain better features for a classification or regression task.What are the different dimensionality reduction techniques?There are multiple dimensionality reduction techniques for machine learning. We will cover 12 such techniques in this course:Why should I learn dimensionality reduction?That\u2019s a fair question! Here are a few key reasons why every machine learning professional should know dimensionality reduction:We could go on, but you get the point! Dimensionality reduction is a crucial cog in the machine learning project lifecycle.I already know what Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is. Do I really need to learn more dimensionality reduction techniques?Absolutely. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique but it does have its challenges. You should consider this course as a Siwss Army Knife in your dimensionality reduction skill set!Learning the various dimensionality reduction techniques will help you become a better machine learning practitioner and expand your horizons when you\u2019re working on different machine learning problems.Do I need to have huge computational power to apply dimensionality reduction?The question on computational power varies from the volume of data we have. For a dataset containing millions of records and thousands of dimensions one needs to have huge computational power to reduce the dimensions and make the data suitable for building models.Where as if the dataset contains only less records and dimensions the computational power required will be very less.

Swift\u2019s flexibility, ease of use, excellent documentation, and quick execution speed are key reasons behind the language\u2019s recent prominence in the data science space.Swift is a more efficient, stable and secure programming language as compared to Python. In fact, Swift is also a good language to build for mobile. In fact, it\u2019s the official language for developing iOS applications for the iPhone!The cherry on the cake for Swift? It has the support of the likes of Google, Apple, and FastAI behind it!\u201cI always hope that when I start looking at a new language, there will be some mind-opening new ideas to find, and Swift definitely doesn\u2019t disappoint. Swift tries to be expressive, flexible, concise, safe, easy to use, and fast. Most languages compromise significantly in at least one of these areas.\u201d \u2013 Jeremy HowardAnd when Jeremy Howard endorses a language and starts using it for his daily data science work, you need to drop everything and listen.In this free course on Swift for Data Science, we will learn about Swift as a programming language and how it fits into the data science space. If you\u2019re a Python user, you\u2019ll notice the subtle differences and the incredible similarities between the two. We showcase Swift code as well in the course so get started!It\u2019s a fair question. Most data science folks you\u2019ll talk to will encourage you to learn Python before Swift. But as we covered above, Swift has its own share of advantages over Python as the programming language you should learn for data science.Here\u2019s Jeremy Howard espousing the value and awesomeness of the Swift programming language:Who is the Swift for Data Science Course for?The Swift for Data Science course is targeted towards anyone who:What do you need to get started with the Swift for Data Science course?Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:You\u2019re ready to take your first steps into the world of Swift programming for Data Science!What is Swift?Swift is an open-source programming language announced in 2014. Though it is a general-purpose language, it is fast gaining ground in the Data Science space.Are Swift and Python similar?Though Swift and Python are different languages, they are similar in many ways. Both are open-source, though the Swift stack also has a different version for macOS users. Both swift and Python include some functional programming tools and a lot of the data structures in both Python and Swift are similar - like lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.How is Swift different from Python?The syntax of Swift is slightly different from that of Python. Just like Python, Swift was essentially developed by Apple as a holistic mobile application programming language, but its uses in Data Science and Machine Learning catapulted it to fame. The other differences are:Why do I need to learn about Swift?In the fast-evolving field of Data Science, it is important to stay updated on recent developments. Just like Python replaced R, there has been a slew of new programming languages geared towards speed and performance - Swift leads the pack here. Though much newer, it is now in the top 10 languages used by developers and the industry\u2019s support for it only enhances the need for learning Swift.How can I use Swift for Data Science Purposes?You need no better endorsement of technology than Google. One of the most popular machine learning frameworks, Tensorflow introduced a Swift for TensorFlow in 2018. This now combined with other Open Source libraries like SwiftAI, SwiftPlot, etc builds a powerful arsenal of tools for Data Science. Not only this, but for MacUsers, it is compatible with the CoreML library - you can now use it in Google ColabCan Swift be used for Deep Learning too?In short, yes! Swift for Tensorflow(S4TF) library supports deep learning architectures in Swift. Along with CoreML, Swift also has pre-trained models for ComputerVision like ImageNet and ResNet, and GPT-2, BERT, etc for NLPWhat are some other unique features of Swift?What if you could develop a mobile application which automatically tells you if it is a dog or a cat that you are looking at? Since Swift can be combined with CoreML, it can also be used for data science functionalities in mobile applications. Some other unique features are:What are the main disadvantages of Swift?There are some disadvantages of Swift as well.How is Swift being used in the industry?Swift is being used by top companies both as a general-purpose programming language and for Data Science as well.

Machine Learning is re-shaping and revolutionizing the world and disrupting industries and job functions globally.Machine learning is so extensive that you probably use it numerous times a day without even knowing it. From unlocking your mobile phones using your face to giving your attendance using a biometric machine, machine learning is being used in almost every stage.In this age of machine learning, every aspiring data scientist is expected to upskill themselves in machine learning techniques & tools and apply them in real-world business problems.Machine Learning problems can be divided into 3 broad classes:Machine Learning problems can be divided into 3 broad classes:Supervised Machine LearningSupervised Machine LearningUnsupervised Machine LearningUnsupervised Machine LearningReinforcement LearningReinforcement LearningHere is an illustration of these different machine learning problems:Here is an illustration of these different machine learning problems:When you have past data with outcomes (labels in machine learning terminology) and you want to predict the outcomes for the future \u2013 you would use Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. Supervised Machine Learning problems can again be divided into 2 kinds of problems:When you want to classify outcomes into different classes. For example \u2013 whether a customer would default on their loan or not is a classification problem which is of high interest to any BankWhen you are interested in answering how much \u2013 these problems would fall under the Regression umbrella. For example \u2013 what is the expected amount of default from a customer is a Regression problemThere are times when you don\u2019t want to exactly predict an Outcome. You just want to perform a segmentation or clustering. For example \u2013 a bank would want to have a segmentation of its customers to understand their behavior. This is an Unsupervised Machine Learning problem as we are not predicting any outcomes here.It is said to be the hope of true artificial intelligence. And it is rightly said so because the potential that Reinforcement Learning possesses is immense. It is a slightly complex topic as compared to traditional machine learning but an equally crucial one for the future.This course requires no prior knowledge about Data Science or any tool.In this

As a newcomer or beginner in machine learning, you\u2019ll find KNN to be among the easiest algorithms to pick up.And despite its simplicity, KNN has proven to be incredibly effective at certain tasks in machine learning.The KNN algorithm is simple to understand, easy to explain and perfect to demonstrate to a non-technical audience (that\u2019s why stakeholders love it!). That\u2019s a key reason why it\u2019s widely used in the industry and why you should know how the algorithm works.This free course by Analytics Vidhya will help you understand what K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is, how the KNN algorithm works, and where KNN fits in the machine learning umbrella. We will also showcase how to implement KNN in Python and R. There\u2019s a lot to learn so enroll and get started!This course is for anyone who:Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:CourseWhat is the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm?K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is a distance based supervised learning algorithm that is used for solving classification problems. In this, we will be looking at the classes of the k nearest neighbors to a new point and assign it the class to which the majority of k neighbours belong too.To identify the nearest neighbors we use various techniques of measuring distance, the most common of them being the \u00a0\u2018Euclidean Distance\u2019.Why should you learn KNN in machine learning?KNN is among the most widely used and popular machine learning algorithms in the industry. Every data scientist, amateur or established, is expected to know the ins and outs of KNN. You should be able to implement it in Python or R (or any other programming language) if you want to land a role in the machine learning space.Additionally, as you\u2019ll see in the course, KNN unlocks a lot of avenues to solving machine learning problems.When should you use KNN?KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry.Can I use KNN for both classification and regression problems?Yes! We just answered the question above but let\u2019s expand a bit more on that. To evaluate any technique we generally look at 3 important aspects:Ease to interpret outputCalculation timePredictive PowerLet us take a few examples to place KNN on the machine learning scale:Let us take a few examples to place KNN on the machine learning scale:KNN algorithm fairs well across all parameters of considerations. It is commonly used for its ease of interpretation and low calculation time.KNN algorithm fairs well across all parameters of considerations. It is commonly used for its ease of interpretation and low calculation time.What kind of projects can you do using KNN?You can perform both classification and regression projects. From predicting the price of a house (regression) to identifying if a loan will default or not (classification), you can apply KNN across a range of problems.We suggest heading to the DataHack platform, picking up a problem of your choice, and applying KNN there to solidify your practical understanding.Do I need to learn Python or R (or any other programming language) to use KNN?Well - yes and no. While KNN can still be performed on GUI based tools like KNIME, you should still have a working knowledge of how to implement it in Python or R. That\u2019s a key consideration in the machine learning space.Will machine learning project interviews ask you about KNN?There\u2019s a high chance you\u2019ll be asked at least a couple of questions on the KNN algorithm. Depending on the level you\u2019re applying for, you could be asked to explain how KNN works in a certain business scenario and how you would explain the results of a KNN model to a non-technical audience (a very common question!).What does the \u201dK\u201d in KNN stand for?\u201cK\u201d in \u201cKNN\u201d stands for the number of cases that are considered to be \"nearest\" when you convert the cases as points in a euclidean space.That means, if we consider k=3, and when a new point has to be assigned a class, it will be on the basis of the classes of the 3 nearest points that surround the new point as per the euclidean distance.How to calculate the distance between points in KNN?There are various methods for calculating this distance, of which the most commonly known methods are \u2013 Euclidian, Manhattan (for continuous) and Hamming distance (for categorical).

These are two key concepts not just in machine learning, but in statistics as well.Due to their popularity, a lot of data science aspirants even end up thinking that they are the only forms of regression! Or at least linear regression and logistic regression are the most important among all forms of regression analysis.The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between. There are multiple types of regression apart from linear regression:Linear regression is just one part of the regression analysis umbrella. Each regression form has its own importance and a specific condition where they are best suited to apply..Regression analysis marks the first step in predictive modeling. The different types of regression techniques are widely popular because they\u2019re easy to understand and implement using a programming language of your choice.What is Regression Analysis?Regression Analysis is one of the most widely and popularly used techniques of analyzing data. Almost in all the data science courses that exist, regression is one of the first machine learning algorithms to be taught.It is used when there is a cause and effect relationship between the dependent variable (target) and independent variable/variables (predictors).How many types of Regression do we have?There are multiple types of regression techniques for making predictions. Apart from linear regression, here are a few others that are commonly used in the industry and in research:How much mathematical knowledge is required to understand regression?The maths behind regression analysis is simple and easy to understand. The knowledge of maths includes:Don\u2019t worry! We will cover the core concepts in the course itself.Ridge vs. Lasso Regression - what\u2019s the difference?In mathematical terms, Ridge penalises the loss function by adding the squared value of coefficients whereas Lasso Regression penalises the loss function by adding the absolute value of the coefficient of the variable.You\u2019ll find out more about each regression in the course.Which types of problems can be solved using regression?Any problem having a cause and effect relationship can be solved by regression analysis. Regression techniques help you solve both linear and classification problems. Some practical implementations include:What are the major challenges faced by regression techniques?Some of the problems faced by regression techniques include-Is Regression Analysis relevant in the industry?Absolutely! Regression analysis is one of the most commonly used methods in analytics, statistics, and data science projects. Despite the incredible number of breakthroughs in machine learning and the plethora of other algorithms out there, linear regression remains the most popular technique in a lot of organizations.Which programming language works best for regression?Here\u2019s the beauty of regression analysis - you can use any tool or programming language to build regression models. You can perform regression analysis in MS Excel, R, Python, Minitab, KNIME - the list goes on and on.We have used Python to implement the different regression types in this course.What kind of machine learning projects can you do using regression techniques?You can pick up almost any regression problem out there and use the techniques you learn in the course. We suggest heading over to Analytics Vidhya\u2019sDataHack platformand picking up the problem or project you can relate to.DataHack platform\nCurriculum: Welcome to the course!: Welcome!;Introduction
