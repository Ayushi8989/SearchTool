It's easy to learn and will serve you well in your data science journey.What do you need to get started with the Naive Bayes course?What is Naive Bayes?In machine learning, the Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on the concept of Bayes Theorem. Bayes theorem is one of the fundamental theorems in probability. We will be learning all these concepts in the course quite thoroughlyHow are Naive Bayes and probability related?The Bayes Theorem forms the backbone of the Naive Bayes algorithm. We use conditional probability to classify the data - thus, the Naive Bayes algorithm basically gives us the probability of a record being in a particular class, given the values of the features. This is nothing but conditional probability!What are the assumptions we need to keep in mind for using the Naive Bayes algorithm?The most important assumption that Naive Bayes makes is that all the features are independent of each other. You might also need to convert the continuous variables into discrete variables.What are the different types of Naive Bayes algorithms?There are 3 main types of Naive Bayes algorithms:We will be covering all these techniques comprehensively and with Python code in this course.Can Naive Bayes be used only for binary classification?Not at all - in fact, the Naive Bayes classifier is one of the most popular algorithms for multiclass classification. Depending on the data we are dealing with, we can use any of the 3 types of the Naive Bayes algorithmsHow does Naive Bayes hold up against other classification algorithms?Though classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, random forest, etc are quite popular, Naive Bayes holds its own among them. It is faster than Random forest, since it can adapt to changing data pretty quickly. If the assumptions of Naive Bayes hold true, then it is much faster than logistic regression as well.What are the main advantages of Naive Bayes?The main advantages are:What are the main advantages of Naive Bayes?Like all other algorithms, Naive Bayes has its own set of cons as well:What are the applications of the Naive Bayes algorithm?Though the algorithm is relatively simple to understand, you cannot underestimate the power of the Naive Bayes classifier! It is fast, intuitive, and is used for text classification tasks. Since it can be used for multiclass classification as well, it is considered a very versatile and flexible classifier. A majority of research papers on text classification start off by using the Naive Bayes classifier as the baseline model.","Probability: Key Terms and Definitions, Introduction to Probability, Quiz: Introduction to probability, Calculating Probabilities of events, Quiz: Calculating Probabilities of events, AI&ML Blackbelt Plus Program (Sponsored);The Naive Bayes Algorithm: Introduction to Naive Bayes, Quiz: Introduction to Naive Bayes, Conditional Probability and Bayes Theorem, Working of Naive Bayes, Quiz: Conditional Probability and Naive Bayes, Math Behind Naive Bayes, Types of Naive Bayes, Quiz: Types of Naive Bayes, Implementing Naive Bayes, Pros and Cons of Naive Bayes, Applications of Naive Bayes, Improve your Naive Bayes Model;What Next?: More Resources and Next Steps"

You can build an ensemble machine learning model using simple models and yet get great scores which are at par with the resource-hungry models like neural networks.What are the different types of Ensemble Learning techniques?There are simple and advanced ensemble learning techniques.In bagging and Boosting, there are other popular models like Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.We will be covering all these techniques comprehensively and with Python code in this course.Do we use Ensemble Learning techniques only for classification or regression or both?We can use ensemble learning for both types of machine learning problems: Classification and Regression. While techniques like Max Voting are used for classification, techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc can be used for both Classification and Regression problems.What are the more popular ensemble learning techniques?Ensemble learning techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and variants, XGBoost, and LightGBM are extremely popular in hackathons. Depending on the data we are dealing with, we can use these techniques as our machine learning models. For example, you can use LightGBM(Light Gradient Boosting) for large datasets, or CatBoost for when your data has categorical variables.What is the intuition behind Bagging?The idea behind bagging is combining the results of multiple models (for instance, all decision trees) to get a generalized result. Bagging (or Bootstrap Aggregating) technique uses subsets (bags) to get a fair idea of the distribution (complete set).What is the intuition behind Boosting?Boosting is a sequential process, where each subsequent model attempts to correct the errors of the previous model on subsets of the data. The succeeding models are dependent on the previous model. The boosting algorithm combines a number of weak learners to form a strong learner and boost your overall results.What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting?While both bagging and boosting involve creating subsets, bagging makes these subsets randomly, while boosting prioritizes misclassified subsets. Additionally, at the final step in bagging, the weighted average is used, while boosting uses majority weighted voting.Does ensemble learning improve my machine learning model?In a word, yes! And that too drastically! Ensemble learn can improve the results of your machine learning even exponentially at times. There are two major benefits of Ensemble models:As you will learn in the course, we will take a real-life dataset and study how ensemble learning improves the score of our machine learning model as compared to using only simple models.Would knowing about ensemble learning help me crack interviews and hackathons?Ensemble learning is the go-to method to achieve a high rank on hackathon leaderboards. You can go over the winning approaches of multiple hackathons, and there is a guarantee that a majority would have used an ensemble technique as their machine learning model.Not only in hackathons but ensemble models are also used extremely popular in the industry because of how cost-effective they are. That is why, questions on random forest, gradient boosting, stacking, etc are often asked in interviews. Proposing an ensemble learning solution for a problem statement in an interview would always give you an edge over other solutions!Who is the Ensemble Learning and Ensemble Learning Techniques Course for?This course is designed for anyone who:","Introduction: Intuition behind Ensemble Learning, What is Ensemble Learning?, What models will be covered in the course?, Quiz: Introduction to Ensemble Learning, AI&ML Blackbelt Plus Program (Sponsored);Basic Ensemble Learning Techniques: Max Voting, Averaging, Weighted Average, Quiz: Basic Ensemble Techniques;Advanced Ensemble Learning Techniques: Stacking, Implementing Stacking, Variants of Stacking, Blending, Bootstrap Sampling, Quiz: Bootstrap Sampling;Advanced Ensemble Learning: Bagging: What is Bagging?, Bagging Meta-Estimator, Random Forest, Quiz: Random Forest, Hyper-parameters of Random Forest, Quiz: Hyper-parameters of Random Forest, Implementing Random Forest;Advanced Ensemble Learning: Boosting: Introduction to boosting, What is Boosting?, Quiz: Introduction to Boosting, Gradient Boosting Algorithm (GBM), Math Behind GBM, Quiz: Gradient Boosting Algorithm, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Implementing XGBoost, Quiz: XGBoost, AdaBoost: Adaptive Boosting, Implementing AdaBoost, Quiz: AdaBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost;What next?: Next Steps"

Introduction to Web Scraping using Python,"The need and importance of extracting data from the web is becoming increasingly loud and clear. There is an unprecedented volume of data on the internet right now - and data science projects often need this data to build predictive models.That’s a key reason why data scientists are expected to be familiar with web scraping.We have found web scraping to be a very helpful technique for gathering data from multiple websites. Some websites these days also provide APIs for many different types of data you might want to use, such as Tweets or LinkedIn posts.But there might be occasions when you need to collect data from a website that does not provide a specific API. This is where having the ability to perform web scraping comes in handy. As a data scientist, you can code a simple Python script and extract the data you’re looking for.So knowing how to perform web scraping using Python will help you go a long way towards becoming a resourceful data scientist. Are you ready to take the next step and dive in?A note of caution here – web scraping is subject to a lot of guidelines and rules. Not every website allows the user to scrape content so there are certain legal restrictions at play. Always ensure you read the website’s terms and conditions on web scraping before you attempt to do it.In this course, we will dive into the basics of web scraping using Python. We will understand what web scraping is, the different Python libraries for performing web scraping, and finally we’ll implement web scraping using Python in a real-world project. There’s a lot to unpack here so enroll today and start learning!We’re sure you’ve asked these questions before.

You’re all set to perform web scraping on your machine!What is web scraping?Web scraping is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites. This technique mostly focuses on the transformation of unstructured data (HTML format) on the web into structured data (database or spreadsheet).You can perform web scraping in various ways, including use of Google Docs to almost every programming language.Why should you learn web scraping?Web scraping is incredibly useful when you don’t have enough data with you to train a machine learning model. Web scraping helps us to collect this data from websites (if permitted) and we can then use that to train our model. You can imagine why web scraping is such a prized tool in a data scientist’s arsenal!Why Python for web scraping?Python is the most popular tool out there in the world for Web Scraping. Its 2 prominent libraries - BeautifulSoup and Scrapy makes web scraping easy and efficient. Python’s syntax makes understanding of the codes easy. Also python provides many other libraries for web scraping which can be used as per our needs. Eg- lxml, requests etcWhat are the different Python libraries for performing web scraping?There are many libraries in Python that help us to scrape the web. The 3 most prominent libraries include:Can I use R for web scraping?You sure can! You can perform web scraping in both Python and R. We are teaching you how to do this using Python in the course but feel free to use R if that’s your language of choice. You can go throughthis tutorialthat walks you through how to master web scraping using an R package called rvest.Are web scraping concepts asked in data science/machine learning interviews?This depends a lot on the data science role and the organization you’re interviewing for. Not all organizations require you to know or apply web scraping.

Evaluation Metrics for Machine Learning Models,"Evaluation metrics form the backbone of improving your machine learning model. Without these evaluation metrics, we would be lost in a sea of machine learning model scores - unable to understand which model is performing well.Wondering where evaluation metrics fit in? Here’s how the typical machine learning model building process works:Evaluation metrics, essentially, explain the performance of a machine learning model. An important aspect of evaluation metrics is their capability to discriminate among model results.If you’ve ever wondered how concepts like AUC-ROC, F1 Score, Gini Index, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Confusion Matrix work, well - you’ve come to the right course!We have seen plenty of analysts and aspiring data scientists not even bothering to check how robust their machine learning model is. Once they are finished building a model, they hurriedly map predicted values on unseen data.This is an incorrect approach.Simply building a machine learning model is not the motive! It’s about creating and selecting a model which gives high accuracy on an out of sample data (or unseen data). Hence, it is crucial to check the accuracy of your model prior to computing predicted values.This is where evaluation metrics help us.What is an evaluation metric?The answer lies in the name itself! Evaluation metrics help us evaluate, or gauge, the performance (or accuracy) of our machine learning model. They are an integral part of the machine learning model building pipeline as we can iterate and improve our model’s performance by judging how it’s working.What are the different types of evaluation metrics?There are several types of evaluation metrics for machine learning models. The choice of the evaluation metric completely depends on the type of model and the implementation plan of the model.The evaluation metrics varies according to the problem types - whether you’re building a regression model (continuous target variable) or a classification model (discrete target variable).In this course, we’re covering evaluation metrics for both machine learning models. Here’s a taste of the different evaluation metrics you’ll find in the course:Do I really need to master evaluation metrics to understand machine learning?The short answer - yes. Evaluation metrics are critical to judging and improving our machine learning model’s performance. And who doesn’t want to do that?Evaluation metrics are a must-know concept for every machine learning and data science aspirant.What kind of evaluation metrics questions can I expect in an interview?Here are a few common questions we’ve seen asked of beginners about evaluation metrics:You’ll get a better idea about how to answer these questions inside the course.How do evaluation metrics help me improve my hackathon rankings?Evaluation metrics, as you might have guessed by now, will be of supreme importance in machine learning hackathons. Your ranking on the hackathon leaderboard will be based on the evaluation metric being used in that hackathon.There’s no getting away from it - evaluation metrics are the lifeblood of your machine learning model’s performance.Can I use the same evaluation metrics for regression as well as classification problems?Not quite. Regression and classification models have their separate evaluation metrics. Remember , the evaluation metric depends on the target variable. If your target variable is continuous (aka a regression problem), you can’t use a classification metric to evaluate it!Is cross validation an evaluation metric?Cross validation is not technically an evaluation metric but we’ve still included this in the course.

Supervised Machine Learning problems can again be divided into 2 kinds of problems:When you want to classify outcomes into different classes. For example – whether a customer would default on their loan or not is a classification problem which is of high interest to any BankWhen you are interested in answering how much – these problems would fall under the Regression umbrella. For example – what is the expected amount of default from a customer is a Regression problemThere are times when you don’t want to exactly predict an Outcome. You just want to perform a segmentation or clustering. For example – a bank would want to have a segmentation of its customers to understand their behavior. This is an Unsupervised Machine Learning problem as we are not predicting any outcomes here.It is said to be the hope of true artificial intelligence. And it is rightly said so because the potential that Reinforcement Learning possesses is immense.

Fundamentals of Regression Analysis,"Linear regression and logistic regression are typically the first algorithms we learn in data science. These are two key concepts not just in machine learning, but in statistics as well.Due to their popularity, a lot of data science aspirants even end up thinking that they are the only forms of regression! Or at least linear regression and logistic regression are the most important among all forms of regression analysis.The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between. There are multiple types of regression apart from linear regression:Linear regression is just one part of the regression analysis umbrella. Each regression form has its own importance and a specific condition where they are best suited to apply..Regression analysis marks the first step in predictive modeling. The different types of regression techniques are widely popular because they’re easy to understand and implement using a programming language of your choice.What is Regression Analysis?Regression Analysis is one of the most widely and popularly used techniques of analyzing data. Almost in all the data science courses that exist, regression is one of the first machine learning algorithms to be taught.It is used when there is a cause and effect relationship between the dependent variable (target) and independent variable/variables (predictors).How many types of Regression do we have?There are multiple types of regression techniques for making predictions. Apart from linear regression, here are a few others that are commonly used in the industry and in research:How much mathematical knowledge is required to understand regression?The maths behind regression analysis is simple and easy to understand. The knowledge of maths includes:Don’t worry! We will cover the core concepts in the course itself.Ridge vs. Lasso Regression - what’s the difference?In mathematical terms, Ridge penalises the loss function by adding the squared value of coefficients whereas Lasso Regression penalises the loss function by adding the absolute value of the coefficient of the variable.You’ll find out more about each regression in the course.Which types of problems can be solved using regression?Any problem having a cause and effect relationship can be solved by regression analysis. Regression techniques help you solve both linear and classification problems. Some practical implementations include:What are the major challenges faced by regression techniques?Some of the problems faced by regression techniques include-Is Regression Analysis relevant in the industry?Absolutely! Regression analysis is one of the most commonly used methods in analytics, statistics, and data science projects. Despite the incredible number of breakthroughs in machine learning and the plethora of other algorithms out there, linear regression remains the most popular technique in a lot of organizations.Which programming language works best for regression?Here’s the beauty of regression analysis - you can use any tool or programming language to build regression models. You can perform regression analysis in MS Excel, R, Python, Minitab, KNIME - the list goes on and on.We have used Python to implement the different regression types in this course.What kind of machine learning projects can you do using regression techniques?You can pick up almost any regression problem out there and use the techniques you learn in the course.
